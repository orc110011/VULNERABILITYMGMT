-Testing your DNS Server
<p align="center">
In a Command Prompt window, execute this command: netstat -an | findstr :53
Your server should show processes listening on both TCP and UDP ports 53, as shown below.

In a Command Prompt, we need to execute the following command: 
nslookup yahoo.com 8.8.8.8
This looks up the A record for yahoo.com using Google's server.
You should see non-authoritative answers from the google-public-dns server, as shown below.

In a Command Prompt window, we need to execute this command:
nslookup @ modernstoicism.com 127.0.0.1
This looks up the A record for modernstoicism using your my DNS server.
We should see non-authoritative answers from the google-public-dns server, as shown below.

-Performing Three Recursive Queries <br/>
<p align="center">
In a Command Prompt, execute the following commands:
nslookup attack.samsclass.info 127.0.0.1, nslookup fog.modernstoicsm.com 127.0.0.1 nslookup ftp.modernstoicism.com 127.0.0.1

WIRESHARK
-Observing Source Ports
<p align="center">
In Wireshark, click Capture, Stop.
Look in the Info column, on the right side, and click a "Standard query..." packet.
In the middle pane, expand the "User Datagram Protocol..." line.
Right-click "Source port..." and click "Apply as Column", as shown below.

As we can see; the Source Port is RANDOMIZED, unlock WINSERVER 2008, which is a serious server vulnerability, making it far easier to poison the cache on the server.
